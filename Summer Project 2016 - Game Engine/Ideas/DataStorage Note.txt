We need a way to create new tile lists (world tile list) using data saved from previous tile lists.
Position, imageicon (path & imgName), collision or not, layer, etc.
The new (loaded) tile list, needs to consist (NEEDS) of new Tile()'s.
We cannot convert from String (Tile.toString() practically) to Tile.
